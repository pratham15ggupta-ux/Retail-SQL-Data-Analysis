# Motorcycle Retail Sales Analysis (SQL Project)  
 

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes motorcycle and motorcycle accessories sales data using SQL (SSMS) . 
The objective is to extract meaningful business insights related to customers, products, and sales performance.

The analysis includes 13 business-focused SQL queries covering revenue trends, top-performing products, customer behavior, sales timeline ,year trends , and category performance.


##  Business Objectives

- Analyze total sales revenue generated by the business
- Identify top-performing motorcycles and accessories
- Evaluate revenue contribution by product categories
- Understand customer purchasing behavior
- Detect high-value customers
- Analyze sales trends for better business decisions
- Data segmentation for better insights in business
- Finding KPI for analysing performance


## 🗄️ Data Model (Star Schema)

The project follows a star schema design where:
- fact_sales is the central fact table containing transaction-level data.
- dim_products and dim_customers are dimension tables.
- One-to-many relationships connect dimension tables to the fact table.

Each customer and product can have multiple sales records.


##  SQL Concepts Used
